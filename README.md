# Why do Employees Leave?
In this project, I explore a dataset composed of employee data in order to predict employee attritions and discover the main factors behind employee attrition. Using the provided Google Colab link will take you directly to the notebook where all my models were trained. The original data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/patelprashant/employee-attrition. Under the `data` folder are three files, one is `attrition.csv`, the renamed file downloaded from kaggle, and two others `attrition_train.csv` and `attrition_test.csv`. These datasets were created with `split_data.py` so I wouldn't be creating many different train/ test splits when opening my notebook each time. 

- `attrition_model.ipynb`: Notebook containing model training and feature engineering
- `data`: Folder for data
- `split_data.py`: Helper script to construct training and test datasets.

You can watch a Youtube video of me explaining my findings here https://youtu.be/hA3KqkXcQhg.

Thank you!
